# React Query Implementation

Collection of React Query and TypeScript apps showcasing reusable code examples for common data fetching use cases.

This project provides a valuable resource for testing implementations and accelerating development of data fetching features in React applications. The apps cover a wide range of use cases, including:

- Fetching data from REST APIs
- Fetching data from GraphQL APIs
- Caching data
- Handling errors
- Optimizing performance

The code in the apps is well-documented and easy to understand. This makes it a great resource for learning how to use React Query and TypeScript for data fetching.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0riion/react-query-implementations.git
cd react-query-implementations
yarn install
```

## Usage

In the folder `src` there are many folders (crypto-random, crypto-random-query, etc), each one is a different implementation of React Query. In the `App.tsx` file you can import the implementation you want to test and see the results in the browser.

```tsx
import CryptoRandomQueryWithQueryClient from './crypto-random-query';

function App() {
	return <CryptoRandomQueryWithQueryClient />;
}

export default App;
```
